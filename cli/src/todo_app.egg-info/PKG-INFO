# Console-Based Todo Application

A simple command-line todo application written in Python that allows users to manage their tasks through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

- Add new tasks with titles and optional descriptions
- View all tasks with their completion status
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- In-memory storage (no persistence)

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the application directly with Python:

```bash
python src/todo_app.py
```

## Usage

The application presents a numbered menu interface:

1. **Add new task**: Enter a title (required) and description (optional)
2. **List all tasks**: View all tasks with their ID, status, and details
3. **Update task**: Modify an existing task by its ID
4. **Delete task**: Remove a task by its ID
5. **Toggle complete/incomplete**: Change the completion status of a task
6. **Quit**: Exit the application

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:

- `src/models/task.py`: Defines the Task data model
- `src/todo_storage.py`: Implements in-memory storage with CRUD operations
- `src/todo_app.py`: Contains the main application logic and menu system
